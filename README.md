Hey There , My IT Project with my team in level one at Software Engineering program , During COVID-19....We had to work from home , The TA said it's one of the best , We used pure HTML5/CSS3 and also CSS GRID-System to make it responsive ASAP. We took 25 Hours to make it ( Everyone worked 5 hours to build his own )
